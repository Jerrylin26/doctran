    "# Benchmarking vector search on raw emails vs interrogated emails\n",
    "Most LLM applications rely on a knowledge base to provide external context, and use vector similarity search to retrieve this knowledge. One of the most impactful ways to improve the reliability of vector search is to preprocess the input documents to remove any uncessary markup, and to change the way information is presented so it is more similar to how users typically query the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we compare vector search performance on the [Enron email dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/) in two scenarios:\n",
    "1. Indexing emails based on embeddings generated from the raw email\n",
    "2. Indexing emails based on embeddings generated from a series of question and answer pairs about the emails, which are generated by OpenAI's GPT4 API."

    "For use cases where users are expected to **ask questions** rather than provide instructions to a LLM, converting source documents into question and answer pairs is likely to result in more reliable results when performing vector retrieval. For example, this preprocessing technique is likely better suited for customer support or knowledge base search use cases, and less well suited for agent-based workflows."
